# Landing-Page
An exercise in html and css, creating a landing page for a Odin Project assignment.

By the end of this project, I should have attained some basic experience creating
and entire modern landing page of a generic website from scratch. Particularly:

- Utilizing proper front-end web dev practicies.
- Using HTML5, CSS, and Flexbox.
- Continual and effective usage of commits.
